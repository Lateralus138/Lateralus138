## About

About this GitHub profile.

### Description

My home of miscellaneous open source programming projects&#46; Here you will find a library of  unorganized and random programs written in various scripting and programming languages for various operating systems&#46;

### Currently

Planning new versions of [***UniShellect***](https://github.com/Lateralus138/UniShellect), [***ColorStatic***](https://github.com/Lateralus138/colorstatic-bash), [***Bench-CLI***](https://github.com/Lateralus138/bench-cli), and [***YouTube Search Filter***](https://github.com/Lateralus138/YouTubeSearchFilter)&#46; Two of which are scripts that will be re&#45;written in C&#43;&#43;&#46;

### Myself

DADDY of twin demon spawn&#33; Older school &#40;25 years&#41; overall &#40;hard &#38; soft&#41; com tech & gamer&#44; Windows&#44; Linux&#44; &#38; even Apple&#46; I guess you could call me a &#34;hobbyist&#34;&#46;

I specialize in the command line and especially automating things&#46; I do these things in both compiled programming languages and scripts with scripting languages in the various environments&#46;

## Environments

Where and what I do.

### Operating Systems

![Windows Logo](./docs/../images/windows_logo.png)![Linux Logo](./docs/../images/linux_logo.png)![MacOS Logo](./images/macos_logo.png)![Android Logo](docs/media/images/android_logo.png)

I primarily work in *Windows* and *Linux*&#44; but some of my code will compile for *MacOS* and occasionally the *Android* command line as well&#46;

### What and Where

#### Languages 

I&#39;m more than familiar with many languages and even fluent in a few &#40;though I can admit to getting rusty like all the rest&#41;&#44; but for all intents and purposes the primary languages you will see here are ***AutoHotkey***&#44; ***Shell&#47;BASH***&#44; ***C&#43;&#43;***&#44; and ***Fortran*** &#40;for now&#41;&#46;

#### Environment

The command line&#46;&#46;&#46; mostly&#46;

On occasion you might find a GUI&#46;

- ***Windows***
  - ***CMD***&#44; of course&#46; I started in Windows and way back when I started that's what we had&#46;
  - ***PowerShell***&#44; I &#44; of course&#44; advanced along with Windows&#46; 
- ***Linux***
  - ***Shell***
    - ***Bash***&#44; where I feel at home&#46;
    - ***POSIX*** &#40;fairly&#41;&#44; I can convert most things into POSIX if necessary&#46; Fortunately most Linux environments have Bash.
    - ***Other***&#44; I am somewhat familiar with ***ZSH*** and other shells and can fix most things in those functions&#47;scripts&#46;
- ***Other***&#44; &#40;MacOs included somewhat&#41; 
  - &#34;I get around&#34;&#46;&#46;&#46; It doesn&#39;t matter what operating system I am in, I can do whatever&#44; wherever&#46;
